# baitaplon

A new Flutter project.

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project and copy:
- Project URL
- Project API anon key

2. Run the app with `dart-define` values:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

3. Build commands also need the same values, for example:

```bash
flutter build apk --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

The app validates these values on startup. If missing, it throws a `StateError` with setup instructions.
